INTRODUCTION                                   *easy-colorcolumn-introduction*

*easy-colorcolumn* is a Vim plug-in to easily use the |colorcolumn| feature.
You can immediately highlight a column of the cursor or visual-selected
columns.
Of course, you can also immediately clear these highlighting.

This plug-in is performed similarly to the following expression.
>
    let &l:colorcolumn = col('.')

CONFIGURATION                                 *easy-colorcolumn-configuration*

This plug-in does NOT provide any default key mappings.
To enable easy-colorcolumn, you should set your own key mappings at .vimrc.

Mapping examples:
>
    nmap <Space>ca <Plug>(easy-colorcolumn-add)
    xmap <Space>ca <Plug>(easy-colorcolumn-add)

    nmap <Space>ct <Plug>(easy-colorcolumn-toggle)
    xmap <Space>ct <Plug>(easy-colorcolumn-toggle)

    nmap <Space>cc <Plug>(easy-colorcolumn-clear)
    xmap <Space>cc <Plug>(easy-colorcolumn-clear)

If you want to change the color of colorcolumn, add this setting in your
.vimrc.
>
    augroup easy_colorcolumn
        autocmd!
        autocmd ColorScheme * highlight ColorColumn ctermfg=red ctermbg=blue
    augroup END
