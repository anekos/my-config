ROGUE(6)                         Games Manual                         ROGUE(6)



NAME
       rogue - Exploring The Dungeons of Doom With a Rogue Clone

SYNOPSIS
       rogue [ save_file ] [ -s ]

DESCRIPTION
       This game is a clone of the rogue 5.3 game that is part of the Berkeley
       Software Distribution (BSD) Tape.

       The command characters are precisely the same as in standard rogue 5.3.
       h,j,k,l,y,u,b,n  move  you one step.  Capitalize it, and you move until
       you run into something.  Use the control  key  instead,  and  you  move
       until you are next to something.

       Whenever the program asks you for an inventory letter, you can type '*'
       to get a list of the logical choices.  Sometimes,  however,  you  don't
       want  to  see  that  list, but instead you want to see the list of your
       scrolls, potions, weapons, or whatever.  In these cases  you  can  type
       one  of  ?!=:/)]  to see a menu of your scrolls, potions, rings, foods,
       wands, weapons or armor respectively.  This is especially usefull  when
       you  know you want to drop a particular item, a scroll for example, but
       you don't want to pick it from the entire list, just from your  collec-
       tion of scrolls.

       When you type control-a, you are shown a line that looks like:

                 R-Hp: 6.50, E-Hp: 7.00 (!: 2, V: 0)

       This line refers to Hp-raise averages.  Each time your experience level
       goes up, your Hp is increased by a random amount not to exceed 10.   If
       you  are  curious  about  your luck in these raises, you can use the ^A
       command.  In the example above R-Hp  stands  for  "real  Hp"  which  is
       exactly  your average Hp raise during the game.  E-Hp stands for effec-
       tive Hp, and is the same as R-Hp except Hp raises from potions, and Hp-
       subtractions  from  vampires are factored in.  In the above between the
       parentheses, it shows that 2 Hp  points  were  given  as  a  result  of
       quaffing  potions  of  healing,  and that vampires have taken way none.
       All of these Hp numbers refer to you max Hp number; the rightmost  num-
       ber  in  Hp:  (15)22  in  the  status  line at the bottom of your rogue
       screen.

       The 'X' command silently creates  a  file  in  your  current  directory
       called  rogue.screen.   This file contains a copy of your screen at the
       time you typed typed the 'X'   This works at absolutely  any  point  in
       the  program.  It is useful for showing other folks what kind of a mess
       you got into, or what a great game you were having.  This functionality
       means that you cannot use the letter 'X' when 'calling' an object some-
       thing.

       The -s option prints the score file and exits.

       For more detailed directions, read the document A Guide to the Dungeons
       of Doom.
