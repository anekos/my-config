INTRODUCTION					*unite-grep-vcs-introduction*

*unite-grep-vcs* is an unite source package plugin for 'git grep' or 'hg grep'.
There is a similar plugin called unite-git_grep and the difference are:

- unite-git_grep: grep command is called when user hit key in unite interface.
  This behavior is quite different from the default 'grep' source.
- unite-grep-vcs: grep command is called once when user open the unite
  interface. This behavior is similar to the default 'grep' source.
